Instructions for assignment 2

All the files can be found here: https://github.com/ismita/randomized_optimization
It's recommended to download the entire "randomized_optimization" folder.

The files
Each .py files contains the code for the specific problem. The assignment uses Python 3.7 environment.

flipflop_problem.py contains the code to analyze the 4 algorithms (RHC, SA, GA, MIMIC) on flip flop problem. Make sure you have a folder named "flipflop_problem" at the same directory for the .py file to save its results, otherwise an error might occur.

four_peaks_problem.py contains the code to analyze the 4 algorithms (RHC, SA, GA, MIMIC) on four peaks problem. Make sure you have a folder named "four_peaks_problem" at the same directory for the .py file to save its results, otherwise an error might occur.

knapsack_problem.py contains the code to analyze the 4 algorithms (RHC, SA, GA, MIMIC) on knapsack problem. Make sure you have a folder named "knapsack_problem" at the same directory for the .py file to save its results, otherwise an error might occur.

nn_weights.py contains the code to compare the 3 algorithms (RHC, SA, GA) with gradient descent on a neural network. The data for the neural network is also in the folder, and can be downloaded here: https://github.com/ismita/randomized_optimization/blob/main/default.csv

The installation
Before running the .py files, open up a terminal or a command prompt and navigate to the directory of this Python project and type the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

This will install all the required python modules for this assignment.
